This game works best in Chrome. if you have frame rate issues, try change the size of the screen by hitting:

  - 1: 384 x 384;
  - 2: 512 x 384;
  - 3: 640 x 384; //default
  - 4: 640 x 512;
  - 5: 640 x 640;

I forget to add some features because i was running to delivery in time and sleep before 06:00 AM, it's in the engine anyway.
